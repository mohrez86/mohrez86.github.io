## About Me

My name is Mohammad Rezaalipour, also known as Moe. 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the 
[Chair of Software Engineering I](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam),
at the *University of Passau*,
located in the picturesque City of Three Rivers.
I am working under the supervision of 
[Professor Christian Hammer](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/lehrstuhlinhaber?config_id=a8d16e612076595e5b55aa227262539d&group_id=&module=TemplatePersondetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&target=289537&username=hammer50&cHash=55277529dcf6fec1edb321830f19affd).
<!-- You can find [my CV on this page](/cv/). -->

## Research Interests

I am particularly interested in: 
- Software Testing and Analysis
- Software Fault Localization
- Automated Program Repair
- AI4SE and SE4AI
  
My vision is to implement the methods and techniques I propose 
in my research as open-source software tools.

- I developed [PyLLMut](../projects#project-pyllmut),
a Python library that uses LLM models as a backend to generate 
mutants for Python programs.

- As part of my PhD research, I developed [FauxPy](../projects#project-fauxpy),
which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only multi-family fault localization tool
for Python that is available as open-source software.
FauxPy has been tested with 135 real-world bugs across 13 widely 
used Python projects, such as [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and
[Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).

- I also developed [aNNoTest](../projects#project-annotest)
as part of my PhD research,
an annotation-based test generation tool specifically designed for 
neural network programs.
aNNoTest has been tested with 19 real-world neural network programs;
it has found [one bug](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/5209) 
and
[one documentation inconsistency](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6607)
in [Vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision),
PyTorch's machine vision library.
