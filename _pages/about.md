## About Me

I’m Mohammad Rezaalipour, also known as Moe.
I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the
[Chair of Software Engineering I](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam)
at the *University of Passau*, located in the picturesque City of Three Rivers.
I work under the supervision of
[Professor Christian Hammer](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/lehrstuhlinhaber).

## Research Interests

I'm mainly interested in software testing, debugging, and AI for software engineering.
I have also developed some open-source tools (more details on [the projects page](../projects)):

- **[PyLLMut](../projects#project-pyllmut):**  
  A Python library that leverages LLMs to generate mutants for Python programs. 

- **[FauxPy](../projects#project-fauxpy):**  
  To the best of my knowledge, the only open-source, multi-family fault localization tool for Python.  
  Developed during my PhD, FauxPy has been tested on **135 real-world bugs** across **13 widely used Python projects**,
  including [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).  

- **[aNNoTest](../projects#project-annotest):**  
  An annotation-based test generation tool for neural network programs, developed as part of my PhD research.
  aNNoTest has been evaluated on **19 real-world neural network programs**, revealing:  
  - **[One bug](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/5209)**  
  - **[One documentation inconsistency](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6607)**  
  
  both in [Vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), PyTorch's computer vision library.
