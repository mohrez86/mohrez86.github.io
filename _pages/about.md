My name is Mohammad Rezaalipour, also known as Moe. 
I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher, 
working under the supervision of Professor 
Christian Hammer at the 
[University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de/en/), 
located in the picturesque City of Three Rivers.

Prior to my move to Passau, I completed my PhD in Informatics at [USI Universit√† della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch/en) in beautiful Lugano. You can find [my CV on this page](/cv/).

I am particularly interested in software testing and analysis, fault localization, automated program repair, and developing software analysis tools. Notably, as part of my PhD research, I developed [FauxPy](https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy), which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only multi-family fault localization tool for Python that is available as open-source software.

I am mostly active on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-rezaalipour) 
and use
[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad-Rezaalipour-2),
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CuQ9I_YAAAAJ),
and 
[GitHub](https://github.com/mohrez86)
for maintaining and sharing my academic and professional activities.
Feel free to reach out to me through any of these platforms or via **email**.
