## About Me

My name is Mohammad Rezaalipour, also known as Moe. 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the 
[Chair of Software Engineering I](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam),
at the *University of Passau*,
located in the picturesque City of Three Rivers.
I am working under the supervision of 
[Professor Christian Hammer](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/lehrstuhlinhaber?config_id=a8d16e612076595e5b55aa227262539d&group_id=&module=TemplatePersondetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&target=289537&username=hammer50&cHash=55277529dcf6fec1edb321830f19affd).
<!-- You can find [my CV on this page](/cv/). -->

## Contact

I am mostly active on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m-rezaalipour) and use [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammad-Rezaalipour-2), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CuQ9I_YAAAAJ), and [GitHub](https://github.com/mohrez86) for maintaining and sharing my academic and professional activities. Feel free to reach out to me through any of these platforms or via **email**.

## Research Interests

I am particularly interested in: 
- Software Testing and Analysis
- Fault Localization
- Automated Program Repair
  
My vision is to implement the methods and techniques I propose in my research as software tools.
Notably, as part of my PhD research, I developed [FauxPy](https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy), which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only multi-family fault localization tool for Python that is available as open-source software.
FauxPy
has been tested with 135 real-world bugs across 
13 widely used Python projects such as
[Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) and 
[Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas).
I also developed [aNNoTest](https://github.com/atom-sw/annotest), an annotation-based test generation tool for neural network programs.
aNNoTest, has been tested 
with 19 real-world 
neural network programs; it has found [one 
bug](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/5209) 
and [one documentation
inconsistency](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6607)
in [Vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision), PyTorch's machine vision library.

## Education

I completed my PhD in Informatics under the supervision of 
[Professor Carlo Alberto Furia](https://bugcounting.net/) at *Universit√† della Svizzera italiana*
in beautiful Lugano.
I also hold a Master's degree in Software Engineering from [Shahid Beheshti University](https://en.sbu.ac.ir/) in Tehran, the vibrant and historic capital of Iran. 
My Bachelor's degree is in Robotics Engineering from [Shahrood University of Technology](https://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/), located in the culturally rich city of Shahrood.
