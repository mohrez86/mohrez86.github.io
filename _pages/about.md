## About Me

My name is Mohammad Rezaalipour, also known as Moe. 
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the 
[Chair of Software Engineering I](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/software-engineering-i),
at the *University of Passau*,
located in the picturesque City of Three Rivers.
I am working under the supervision of 
[Professor Christian Hammer](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/software-engineering-i/translate-to-englisch-lehrstuhlteam/translate-to-englisch-lehrstuhlinhaber?config_id=a8d16e612076595e5b55aa227262539d&group_id=&module=TemplatePersondetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&target=289537&username=hammer50&cHash=55277529dcf6fec1edb321830f19affd).
You can find [my CV on this page](/cv/).

## Education

Before moving to Passau, I completed my PhD in Informatics under the supervision of 
[Professor Carlo Alberto Furia](https://bugcounting.net/) at *Universit√† della Svizzera italiana*
in beautiful Lugano.

## Research Interests

I am particularly interested in software testing and analysis, fault localization, automated program repair, and developing software analysis tools. Notably, as part of my PhD research, I developed [FauxPy](https://github.com/atom-sw/fauxpy), which, to the best of my knowledge, is the only multi-family fault localization tool for Python that is available as open-source software. I also developed [aNNoTest](https://github.com/atom-sw/annotest), an annotation-based test generation tool for neural network programs.
