## University of Passau, Passau, Germany

I was a co-lecturers for the following courses at the [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de), along with Professor Christian Hammer.

### Programming Paradigms

- Summer 2025: 
[Lecture](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/personendetails?config_id=232ee5ad516ac92bf590f99ac8c2baa8&module=TemplateLecturedetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&seminar_id=534eb5451dbd099d9707b3a5039ce134&cHash=ca55320b38ed6884830f328ce9d35c5f) 
| [Tutorial](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/personendetails?config_id=232ee5ad516ac92bf590f99ac8c2baa8&module=TemplateLecturedetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&seminar_id=29bad7f6f3aeeb03a57a47f66153ea77&cHash=ae3577596f8d791d4229ddd041220c52)

The course introduces a range of programming paradigms
and explains their foundational principles and differences,
helping students learn how to choose the right paradigm and
use it effectively.

### Compiler Construction Lab  
- [Winter 2024/2025](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/software-engineering-i/lehrstuhlteam/personendetails?config_id=232ee5ad516ac92bf590f99ac8c2baa8&module=TemplateLecturedetails&range_id=d33789fe6848842635609cb3c3a3ff66&seminar_id=55f222b1ddb736dbee2ec627faf45279&cHash=f4c6375dd28bbc0be140eccbb4abe7f4)

In this course, students implement a compiler in Java for
[ChocoPy](https://ChocoPy.org), a simplified, statically typed dialect of Python, specifically designed for compiler construction courses.

## USI, Lugano, Switzerland

I was a TA for three different courses over eight semesters at [USI Università della Svizzera italiana](https://www.usi.ch) while doing my PhD.

### Programming Fundamentals 1
- [Fall 2023/2024](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35268178/programming-fundamentals-1)
- [Fall 2022/2023](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35265698/programming-fundamentals-1)
- [Fall 2021/2022](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35263600/programming-fundamentals-1)
- [Fall 2020/2021](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35262255/programming-fundamentals-1)
- [Fall 2019/2020](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35260902/programming-fundamentals-1)

Programming Fundamentals 1 (PF1) teaches first-year bachelor's students how to write programs well, regardless of the programming language.
You can see some of PF1's final projects implemented by our students in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhnO80Oj5_8).

### Software Atelier 4: Software Engineering Project
- [Spring 2021/2022](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35263656/software-atelier-4-software-engineering-project)
- [Spring 2020/2021](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35262270/software-atelier-4-software-engineering-project)


Software Atelier 4 (SA4) prepares students to be both skilled programmers
and effective team players by teaching them how to work in large teams and
develop complex software systems.

### Compiler Construction
- [Spring 2019/2020](https://search.usi.ch/en/courses/35260839/compiler-construction)

Compiler Construction teaches students about the different tasks performed by compilers and exposes them to the tools and techniques required to construct them.
